<h1>AR/VR Portfolio IV</h1>
  
  <h2>Blog</h2>
<p>For this particular portfolio project using Twine2, there have been certain aspects which have been fully intuitive, and others that came across as mind blowing frustrations.  To start with the positive aspects of using twine there are multiple tutorials on the twine website that made the experience fairly pleasant.  Creating an interactive web using basic html and CSS actually increased my knowledge of the two languages.  During the process of creating and adding some basic styles to the project I came across a very useful website that I wish I had found much sooner in the semester (the link will be below).</p>
 
  <script src="http://www.w3schools.com/html/"></script>
  
<p>w3schools is a very easy to navigate website that has many tutorials built into it.  Apart form other tutorials we have used throughout the course, I found myself understanding the material a little better with this particular website.  For future coding students, I would highly recommend using this website.</p>
  
<p>As for the more difficult parts of the portfolio project, my issues derived from just a lack of knowledge about building website.  This course has been my first experience with coding and stylesheets and all of my issues stemmed from just not understanding some of the language differences between html, CSS and Javascript.  The main issues I encountered was from the Twine website tutorial about publishing your project.  I published the project and it gave me an html file inside of a notepad document.  In order to add this to my project, I assumed I was supposed to add this file into a Github document, and did so by attempting to add the html file to the already existing page that I had created.  Unfortunately, and I guess obviously did not work.  I spent 7 hours trying different ways to make the project work together, though I didn’t know what I was doing wrong... That is until I found a particular forum that made my 3 day and 7 hour quest a redundant blunder.  I finally found someone who had a similar issue, as they were new to the coding world as well.  The forum post simply said: “twine gives you the html for your interactive story, the html file is a webpage in itself”.</p>
  
<p>OOHH…  Yeah, the experience using Twine has been more of an adventure than anything.  In my twine story, I mention taking a journey to the Paleolithic.  Little did I know I had been taking a journey into the world of coding myself.  The experience has been fulfilling to say the least, after all of the frustration and internet searches to find a solution has been fairly rewarding.  The mass of searching also helped me gain more of an understanding of webpage building.</p>
  
<p>As for using technologies such as twine for the purpose of archaeological education, there can be great benefit for using them to tell a story.  The interactivity of twine engages audiences and allows them to discover new information at their own pace.  The ability to link certain pages together can give viewers an individual experience, and allow them to navigate through the information at their own pace.  In the end the ability to control the information you are discovering gives a sense of control to the intended audience.
